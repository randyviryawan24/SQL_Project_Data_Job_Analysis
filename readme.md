# Introduction
Welcome to my **SQL Portfolio Project**, where I delve into the **data job market** with a focus on **data analyst roles**. This project is a personal exploration into identifying the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and the intersection of high demand with high salary in the field of data analytics.
Check out my SQL queries here:
[**project_file**](/project_file/)
# Background
The motivation behind this project stemmed from my desire to understand the data analyst job market better. I aimed to discover which skills are paid the most and in demand, making my job search more targeted and effective. 

The data for this analysis is from Luke Barousse’s SQL Course **https://lukebarousse.com/sql**. This data includes details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. 

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for a data analyst looking to maximize job market value?
# Tools I Used
In this project, I utilized a variety of tools to conduct my analysis:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Enabled me to interact with the database, extract insights, and answer my key questions through queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database management system, PostgreSQL allowed me to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** This open-source administration and development platform helped me manage the database and execute SQL queries.
- **Github**: Essebtial for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking. 
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
